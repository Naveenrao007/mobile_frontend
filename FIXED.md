# ✅ Frontend Error Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Installed `@expo/metro-runtime@~5.0.5` dependency
2. ✅ Updated `package.json` to include the dependency
3. ✅ Frontend server should now start properly

## 🚀 Start Frontend Now

```powershell
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Note**: Port 8083 was in use, so it will use **8084** instead.

## ✅ What to Expect

After running `npm start`, you should see:
- Expo dev server starting
- QR code for mobile
- Options: `w` for web, `a` for Android, `i` for iOS

## 🌐 Access Frontend

- **Web**: http://localhost:8084 (or 8083 if available)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000 (make sure it's running!)

## 🎯 Test Login

- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Frontend is ready!** 🎉
